## About Me

Hello! I am a PhD student in the Machine Learning Department at Carnegie Mellon University. I am lucky to be advised by [Prof. Zico Kolter](https://zicokolter.com/).

## Research Interests

I look at ML models as information processors -- they take in some bits and produce some other bits. Their input and output patterns tell us many aspects of the model, including privacy, memorization, robustness, etc.
I am also generally interested in information theory, compression, and many TCS fields like cryptography and online algorithms.
